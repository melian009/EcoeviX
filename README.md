Abstract
Biological systems consist of elements that interact within and across hierarchi-
cal levels. For example, interactions among genes determine traits of individuals,
competitive and cooperative interactions among individuals influence population
dynamics, and interactions among species affect the dynamics of communities
and ecosystem processes. Such systems can be represented as hierarchical
networks, but can have complex dynamics when interdependencies among
levels of the hierarchy occur. We propose integrating ecological and evolutionary
processes in hierarchical networks to explore interdependencies in biological
systems. We connect gene networks underlying predatorâ€“prey trait distributions
to food webs. Our approach addresses longstanding questions about how
complex traits and intraspecific trait variation affect the interdependencies
among biological levels and the stability of meta-ecosystems.


Summary
* We build on recent studies to show how hierarchical networks can
provide a framework for improving the study of the interplay between
ecological and evolutionary processes.
* In this framework, interaction strength between species depends on
ecological and evolutionary processes underlying complex traits and
trait distributions, intraspecifc niche width, and the interaction with
either common or rare phenotypes.
* This approach illustrates broad classes of interactions between
complex trait distributions and trait change and the complexity and
stability of ecological networks.
